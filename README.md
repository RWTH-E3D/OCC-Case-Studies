# OCC-Case-Studies
This repository contains a collection of occupant-centric control and operations field implementations. 

Occupant-centric controls (OCC) are a strategy to leverage passively and actively collected data about occupants to achieve customized and optimized controls and improve building performance (energy, comfort, etc.). This is a deliverable of the IEA EBC Annex 79 - Occupant-Centric Building Design and Operation (https://annex79.iea-ebc.org/).
As an emerging approach, there is a lack of standardization and publicized case studies. The aim of this digital deliverable was to develop a library of OCC case studies from around the world. These database was build based on a survey including approximately 90 questions aiming categorizing differnt types of OCC case studies.

The survey was distributed widely to research starting April 2022. There are currently 58 valid responses from five continents. The majority of the buildings are university buildings, offices, or residential buildings. The scope of the case study analysis includes building and occupant metadata, systems and controls, sensing technologies, occupant interactions with interfaces, machine learning applications, and interventions. Of the 58 case studies, fewer than half involved occupant interactions with interfaces; most of these focused on passively learning occupant preferences. More than half of the case studies focused on HVAC, and a quarter focused on lighting.

The survey will be made available by December 18, 2023, for new data collection.
